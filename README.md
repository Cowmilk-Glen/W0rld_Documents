# Known Bugs in the game (v1.0.0)
  - UE4 lighting focuses on the brightest light, which darkens out everything else
  - Some walls are to high for guard bots
  - Some UI for the mini games do not show the correct text, but still works
  - In Light puzzle mini game, it is possible to go past 2 tries
  - 2nd twitch UI not working
  - you can beat the game by turning around at the maze end door while in a corner against the door
  - sound seems a bit off with the OnOff bots, most likley due to them turning Off at diffrent times.
